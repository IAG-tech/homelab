# 🏠 Homelab

This repository documents my hands-on journey into networks, Linux, system administration and security hardening through a personal homelab.

## 🎯Goals

- Build a solid base in networks (routing, VLANs,  DNS, VPNs).
- Improve security/hardening practices.
- Strengthen Linux system administration skills.
- Learn by doing instead of only reading or lab simulating.


## ✅ Current Progress / 🔜 Roadmap
| Status |  Topic | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ✅ | SSH access with ED25519 keys | Secure login |
| ✅ | Basic Pi-Hole setup | DNS ad-blocking running |
| ⌛ | Pi-hole documentation | In progress |
| ⌛ | Add Unbound (private recursive DNS) | Improves privacy and speed |
| 🔜 | WireGuard VPN (Zaragoza ↔️ Village) | Remote access  |
| 🟦 | Monitoring stack (Grafana/Prometheus) | Medium term |
| 🟦 | Automation and backup strategy | Medium term |
| 🟦 | Firewall (OPNsense) | Medium term |
| 🟦 | Site-to-site WireGuard tunnel |  Medium term |
  
This roadmap evolves as the lab grows and new experiments appear.

## 🧠 Philosophy

 *Build, break, learn and repeat until mastery.*
 
## 💻 Devices and software

- **Raspberry Pi 2B (Zaragoza):**
  
  - Raspberry Pi OS Lite
  - SSH with ED25519 keys
  - Pi- hole
    
*If you´re into networks, self-hosting and learning by doing - welcome!*
